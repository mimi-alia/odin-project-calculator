# odin-project-calculator

This is a basic calculator for the final introduction in the Odin project.
Currently only exists in the console.

It is not styled and does not include a clear button. I also did not handle the error for when the equals sign
is pressed multiple times. The only goal was to get the functions to work. Left intentionally incomplete due to time constraints.
